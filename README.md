Artificial Neural Network

## Project

### Overview
This project focuses on optimizing and analyzing a CNN model using the MNIST extended dataset.
The final code and report will soon be uploaded.

### Objective
Train a self-designed CNN or pretrained CNN model on the MNIST extended dataset to find an optimal combination of accuracy and inference time.

### Methodology
1. **Dataset Analysis**: Analyze the MNIST extended dataset and split it into training, validation, and test sets.
2. **Baseline Training**: Train and compare the LeNet-5 and ResNet-50 models.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose the final model based on the analysis of multiple candidates, including both self-designed and pretrained models.
4. **Optimization and Analysis**:
    - Optimize model and training hyperparameters to achieve maximum performance.
    - Analyze results based on training time, inference time, and accuracy.
    - Evaluate performance using the EMNIST test dataset.
    - Present learning curves over epochs.
    - Provide an overall assessment of CNN development results.
